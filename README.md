NOTE: I do NOT have an installable package created so the instructions below
are for some future date.

This is the first JS project I've ever done so I have no idea about JS ecosystem and
how to construct installers for it. I just manually copied files to the Coc extensions folder
and it seems to work.

`:CocInstall coc-ltls`

## Keymaps

`nmap <silent> <C-l> <Plug>(coc-coc-ltls-keymap)`
